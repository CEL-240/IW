#### Information Environment Defined
* the aggregate of social culteral and psychological technical and physical factors that affect how humans and systems drive meaning from info

* Human aspects (Interactions)

#### Informational aspect of the information environment
* Informational aspacts reflect the way that individuals, information systems, and groups communicate and exchange information. Informational aspects are the sensory inputs of activities that a reciever interprets and uses to assign meaning.
